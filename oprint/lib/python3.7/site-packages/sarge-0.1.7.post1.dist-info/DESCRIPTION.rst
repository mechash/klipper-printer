The sarge package provides a wrapper for subprocess which provides command
pipeline functionality.

This package leverages subprocess to provide easy-to-use cross-platform command
pipelines with a Posix flavour: you can have chains of commands using ``;``, ``&``,
pipes using ``|`` and ``|&``, and redirection.

The latest version of sarge can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/vsajip/sarge/>`_.

The latest documentation (kept updated between releases) is on `Read The Docs <http://sarge.readthedocs.org/>`_:
